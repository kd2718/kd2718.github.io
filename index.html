                Hi, My name is Kory Donati. I live in the Central Valley, California with my Wife and two kids. I have a
                strong passion for learning technology and am always looking for a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>I have worked on several projects over the years. I spent two years writing web apps with
                <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>. On top of that I am currently working as a Data
                Warehouse Developer. In this job I write ELT code for my employer's Data Warehouse. Programming and data
                both come fast to me.</p>
            <p>I am always looking for a new challenge, so Feel free to email me at the address below! I am currently
                interested in part time work and am open to interesting ideas. Here is a quick list of a few of the
                technologies I have experience with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Django</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>Celery</li>
                <li>REST APIs</li>
                <li>Javascript Frameworks like Angular and React</li>
                <li>Dotnet Core</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If any of these talents sound interesitng to you, please contact me at: <br /><span
